    "## Alibaba Downsampling: Less is More\n",
    "Developing the click-through-rate machine learning and deep learning pipelines involves algorithm evaluation and selection, hyperparameter tuning for each algorithm, model validation and evaluation, neural network architecture development, search, validation, and selection. Further increasing the complexity of the task at hand, large datasets can significantly increase computational expense and time complexity. For instance, the time complexity for support vector machines is O(n3m) {cite}`SupportVectorMachines` in the number of observations (n) and the number of features (m). Even more, our neural architecture search will train and evaluate 100s to 1,000s of models which can become computationally intractable with millions of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Downsampling the Alibaba Ad Display Click dataset can significantly reduce the computational, network, and IO costs; yet, the samples must be representative of the full dataset. To ensure that the downsamples reflect the characteristics of the original dataset, we implement a class-proportional, distribution-preserving, downsampling strategy inspired by {cite}`lotschOptimalDistributionpreservingDownsampling2021` that repeatedly samples and evaluates the similarity of the sample distribution density with that of the original dataset. The downsample that is most similar to the distribution density of the original dataset is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distribution Density Measure\n",
    "Several statistical methods are available for measuring and comparing density distributions. For this assignment, we will measure the degree to which the data follow a normal distribution using the Anderson-Darling test. The test statistic is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A^2=-n-S$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S=\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{(2i-1)}{n}[\\text{ln}\\, F(Y_i) + \\text{ln}(1-F(Y_{n+1-i}))]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$F$ is the [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) of the normal distribution, $Y_i$ is *ordered* data and $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selection Criteria\n",
    "Using the Anderson Darling test statistic, the best subsample will be that which had the smallest distance in each variable from the distribution of the respective original variable. Concretely, we will select the best sample as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{sample}_{best} = \\min{(\\max{(|A^2\\text{orig}_i-A^2\\text{sample}_i}|})) \\space \\forall \\space i\\in {0,1,...,p}\n",
